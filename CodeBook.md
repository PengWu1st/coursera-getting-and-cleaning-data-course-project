Each row of the data denotes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
The combination first two varibles are the unique identifer:
* subject - The ID that identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* activity - The type of activity that the subject performed
   * WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test
   * WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
   * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
   * SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test
   * STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test
   * LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test

The remaining 79 variables are the mean of each measurement for each activity and each subject.
Here are the meaning of each part of the variable names:
* t - Time domain signal
* f - Fast Fourier Transformed signal
* Body - Body 
* Gravity - Gravity 
* Acc - Accelerometer
* Gyro - Gyroscope
* Mean - Mean
* Std - Standard Diviation
* Jerk - Jerk signal
* mag - magnitude
* X/Y/Z -3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
